In RimWorld, every Pawn has a few traits selected from a pool that makes them that little more unique. These also tend to influence their behavior, skill set, and demeanor towards other Pawns.

A list can be found here for DMs with busy schedules, but every [trait in vanilla RimWorld](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Traits) can be fairly easily translated into this system.

That is to say, drugs.                  | You're exceptionally good at locatinghidden drugs, and have various caches you yourself have hidden around places you frequent. Your personal caches contain single doses of low-grade drugs such as Smokeweed Joints and Yayo.<br><br>Once per long rest, you may use Locate Cache to locate one of your hidden caches, so long as you are somewhere that you frequent. To do so, roll an INT check and add an additional 5.

| Teetotaler           | You abhor the idea of ingesting drugs for anything but medical reasons, and dislike those who do so. | Your character will refuse to ingest any drug for non-medical reasons, including when told to do so by you, the player.<br><br>However, should you be _forced_ to ingest a non-medical drug, you will never gain an addiction, but suffer a morale **penalty** equal to the usual morale **boost** the drug would usually apply.
