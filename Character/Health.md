In RimWorld, your characters' effectiveness in both combat and their day-to-day is determined in part by their overall wellbeing. If a character has a scar on their hand, they will struggle more when using it, and also may experience pain from the scarring. While scars and other minor injuries aren't directly tracked in this reflavor, major organ damage - and upgrades - *are*.

## Perception
Your overall perception is, as one would assume, heavily affected by your sensory organs. If you have a missing or damaged eye, you're going to struggle with vision-based tasks. If you've gone deaf in one ear, you'll suffer a penalty when rolling for SHL, as well as anything else auditory.

The following tables go into depth about what each major organ assists with.

#### Eyes
Your eyes have just 10 HP each, so they're very easy to lose when they're damaged!

| Check              | Penalty Per 10% of Damage | Notes                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Perception (Sight) | -1                        | Only apples for the most damaged eye, unless one is completely missing.              |
| RNG (To Hit)       | -2                        | ^                                                                                    |
| Work Speed         | -5%                       | ^                                                                                    |
| SHA                | -1                        | Only applies once, per damaged eye with <= 50% HP.                                   |
| AC                 | -0.1                      | Only applies for the most damaged eye, unless one is completely missing. Round down. |
### Ears
Your ears are less likely to be hit during combat, but are integral to social interaction and difficult to replace. Each ear has two parts that can be damaged, the inner ear which has 5HP, and the outer ear, which has 10HP. The inner ear is most commonly damaged by explosions (and gunfire without hearing protection such as a military-grade helmet or earplugs), while the outer ear is only ever damaged in melee.

| SHA                  | -1                        | Inner            | The most damaged inner ear incurs the full penalty, while the other only incurs half.                                                 |
| Beauty               | -1                        | Outer            | Only applies after 50% damage, and only once per ear, twice if the outer ear is fully destroyed.                                      |
| AC                   | -0.25                     | Inner            | Did you know the inner ear is responsible for your sense of balance, helped in part by your eyes? It's true! Round this penalty down. |
| Perception (Hearing) | -0.5                      | Outer            | Round this value down.                                                                                                                |

### Nose
The nose is only ever damaged in melee. It has

| Perception (Smell) | -2                        | Applies once past 50%, twice when fully destroyed. |
### Tongue
The tongue has 2HP, and is only ever (and extremely rarely) damaged in melee combat.

## Manipulation
Manipulation is a measure of your manual dexterity. It is mainly influenced by the arms, hands, and fingers, though that's not to say other body-parts and bionic enhancements are out of the question.

Manipulation is a direct modifier your Global Work Speed, as well as your chance to hit in combat.
> [!!] Manipulation affecting to-hit during combat is an **optional** rule, to bring D&D more in line with RimWorld. Discuss with your group whether or not you wish to use it prior to playing.
- When doing a work task, multiply your Manipulation score by 10 to make it a percentage, and then decrease the amount of time it will take to complete the task by that much.
- When rolling initiative, your DM may also ask you to divide your Manipulation by two, and subtract 10. Add this as a modifier to your to-hit for the rest of combat. **This ignores injuries sustained after rolling initiative.**

### Calculating Manipulation
Manipulation has a base value of 20. This can be increased through bionics and other means, but more often than not will be decreased due to damage to the arms, hands, and fingers.
Each finger has 2 HP, the hands themselves have 10HP, and the arms have 20HP.
- Each point of damage to a finger lowers your manipulation by 1
- Each point of damage to a hand lowers your manipulation by 0.5 (rounded down)
- Each point of damage to an arm lowers you manipulation by 0.1 (rounded down)

See [[Prosthetics & Bonics]] for each one's effect on manipulation.
