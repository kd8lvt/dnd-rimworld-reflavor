Bionics are to sci-fi as potions are to medieval fantasy. The former is just more technologically advanced.

Speaking of advanced tech, not all replacements are created equally. A peg leg is "good enough" but you'll be much more effective at walking with at least a proper prosthetic. As such, there are a few tiers of replacements.

1. Missing: If a body-part is completely missing, it's actively hindering you. At least a heavily-damaged leg can still be limped on. These include the obvious "missing body-part" but also include things like golden eyes and prosthetic noses. 
2. Primitive: A shoddy replacement is better than nothing! These typically have a 40% efficiency when compared to natural body-parts. These include peg-legs and hook hands. Enjoy true pirate living with primitive prosthetics.
3. Prosthetic: A limb that works nearly as well as a natural one, at around 80% efficiency. These are Industrial-tier technology, usually. 
4. Natural: Can't blame 'em for what their momma gave 'em! These limbs are au-naturale, and as such are the baseline. Not much to say here.
5. Bionic: These early-spacer tier replacements are just a little better than a natural body-part, at around 120% efficiency.
6. Advanced Bionic: These late-spacer tier replacements are quite a bit better than a natural body-part, with 150% efficiency!
7. Archotech Bionics: These rare, archotech-created body-parts are indistinguishable from a natural body part in every way, aside from being *twice* as powerful and the insides being biomechanical. They also heal like a natural body-part, though again at that 2x efficiency.
8. Specialized Replacements: These body-parts are designed with a specific goal in mind - whether it be to make a gardener even better at sowing  and harvesting seeds, to allow a miner to drill for ore without getting tired, or simply to provide some extra toughness to soldiers. They tend to come with a slight efficiency loss, however, due to this one-track design philosophy. This category includes things like Armorskin, Drill Arms, and the Green Thumb.
9. Implants: This is a catch-all category for bits that don't replace anything, but still are in some way part of the user's body. Things like the Neurocalculator, Toughskin Gland, Tactical HUD, Mechlink, and many others.

## Bionic Fatigue
When doing body-modding on the Rim, you often hear the term "Bionic Fatigue" thrown around. This is a term referring to the strain non-natural body-parts impart on the host's immune system. The average person can only handle so much metal in them before their immune system goes completely AWOL and starts causing havoc. This can be mitigated somewhat by expensive immunosuppressants, but is best handled by not reaching that point in the first place.

Luckily, the same techniques that ushered in the age of bionics were originally intended to allow an organ donation to come from anyone, rather than someone that matches a recipient's immune profile. As such, in 5500, a body-part no longer needs to come from a "matching" donor like it does now in the 2020s - as long as it's human, your immune system doesn't care.

### Tolerance
Bionic Fatigue works on a point-based system. Depending on your traits, your immune system may be more or less Tolerant to artificial parts. Each part has a "Strain", which directly subtracts from the host's Tolerance. If your Tolerance dips below certain thresholds, you will begin experiencing Bionic Fatigue. Let your Tolerance get too low, and you will eventually die.

### Managing Bionic Fatigue
The primary way most diehard body-modders manage their Tolerance is through immunosuppressants. These drugs are expensive, but will completely halt the progression of Bionic Fatigue for a time. **They do not reverse it, only pause it.**

Another way to manage Bionic Fatigue is through Naturalization Serums. These specially-designed serums lessen or even outright negate the effect a specific type of bionic has on the user's immune system *permanently*. For example, an "Armorskin Naturalization Serum" would lessen the Tolerance impact that Armorskin and Armorskin alone has. That said, using them is risky, as you never know if the guy you bought it from is telling the truth, and there's no going back after injecting it.

The final way to manage Bionic Fatigue is by taking regular doses of Luciferium. Aside from removing an implant or bionic (something that is costly, risky, and tedious to do) the only way to reverse the progression of Bionic Fatigue is to take the devil's bargain. Each dose of Luci will reverse the user's Bionic Fatigue by 10%. However, Luciferium is both a nightmare to get a steady supply of, and a permanent commitment. Withdrawal symptoms of Luciferium will eventually conclude with bouts of murderous rage, followed by a short coma, then death.

## Bionic Inflammation
Bionic Inflammation is a measure of how annoyed your immune system is with your artificial body-parts. It functions similarly to inflammation like that of an allergic reaction, but the effects are initially nearly silent, and much nastier.

Bionic Inflammation has 5 severity levels, corresponding to 25% chunks of remaining Tolerance, and 0. The following list covers the effects of each level of Immune Fatigue:
1. 100-75% of Tolerance remaining.
   - The effects of Bionic Inflammation at this point are minimal, and not yet causing Bionic Fatigue.
   - Some people report redness and itchiness around the site of implant incisions and where metal meets flesh.
     
2. 74-50% of Tolerance remaining.
   - Bionic Fatigue increases by 1% every time you take a long rest, unless you are under the effect of an immunosuppressant.
   - Other symptoms include occasional visual glitches in bionic eyes and other sensory anomalies, as well as increased light sensitivity, low fever, tachycardia, swelling around the site of implant incisions and where metal meets flesh, as well as irregular heartbeat, a minor increase in generalized anxiety, and in rare cases symptoms of clinical depression.
     
3. 49-25% of Tolerance remaining.
   - Bionic fatigue increases by 5% every time you take a long or short rest, unless you are under the effect of an immunosuppressant.
   - Other symptoms include unprompted outbreaks of hives across remaining skin, momentary swelling of the throat leading to short-term anaphylaxis, unprompted movements in artificial limbs reminiscent of Alien Hand Syndrome, short seizures caused by voltage imbalances in neural interfaces, and ankylosing of both artificial and natural joints.
     
4. 24-1% of Tolerance remaining.
   - Bionic Fatigue increases by 10% every 4 hours, regardless of activity. If you are under the effect of an immunosuppressant, the rate is 5% every 8 hours.
   - Your top priority should be to remove something to return to a previous stage of inflammation.
   - Other symptoms of Stage-4 Bionic Inflammation include: heart palpitations, stroke, vivid hallucinations, sustained psychosis, dangerously high fever, heightened anxiety, paranoia, sudden natural organ failure, sudden implant failure, chemical poisoning due to immune corrosion of various components, and mass necrosis of natural tissues in the body.
     
5. 0% of Tolerance remaining.
   - Your immune system has had enough of your $#!7, and starts deconstructing your body, starting with what's left of the brain after the mass necrosis of Stage-4.
   - You die. Game over. No do-overs.
